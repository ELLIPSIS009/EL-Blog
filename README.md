# Introduction
A blog is a frequently updated online personal journal or diary. It is a place to express yourself to the world. A place to share your thoughts and your passions. Really, it’s anything you want it to be. For our purposes we’ll say that a blog is your own website that you are going to update on an ongoing basis with different types of educative content. <br><br>
Blogs range from the personal to the political and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects. It can also play an important role in student’s life.
